"""

# your code below:

def merge_lists(x,y):
    return x+y

a = [1,3,5]
b = [2,4,6]
print(merge_lists(a,b))






































# solution Below:

# def merge_lists(list_a, list_b):
#     return list_a + list_b
#
# my_list = merge_lists([1,2,3],['a', 'b', 'c'])
# print(my_list)
